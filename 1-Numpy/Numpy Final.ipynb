        "## So why are Lists slow and Numpy fast?\n",
        "- **Numpy uses fixed types**: Each element in an array in numpy is only represented by default by a 32 bit size value(You can make it less). Whereas lists have to store 4 values for each element in a list. Object value(different for each type), Object Type(type of element), Reference Count(No of times it is referenced) and size of the element. This makes it faster to access and put data into numpy than for lists\n",
        "\n",
        "- **No typechecking when iterating through objects**: When we are iterating through a Numpy array, you don't have to do type checking for each element as all are the same type. But in lists you have to check type of each element.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numpy uses contiguous memory**: Lists don't use contiguous memory whereas Numpy uses contiguous memory like arrays in C. So accessing each element is faster in Numpy as you can just go one step forward. Whereas in Lists you have to map each element to it's memory and then access each memory location.(There are also further benefits like being able to use SIMD Vector Processing elements in the CPU but they are not in the scope of today's workshop).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numpy allows usage of Broadcasting**: Numpy allows use of broadcasting which means that we can do operations with incompatible array sizes. We will get back to this later as this is an important aspect of numpy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numpy allows element wise operations**: Numpy allows us to do element by element operations whereas lists give errors. Ex: [1,2,3]+[4,5,6] gives error in lists but gives [5,7,9] in Numpy. This is also an important aspect of Numpy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numpy supports vectorization**: Numpy allows us to use vectorization which significantly boost the performance of arrays. We'll take a look at this later.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Now, What do I mean by multidimensional data?. It's multiple data arranged in orderly manner. A good analogy is Cupboard. Multiple rows and columns that you can take and save data from and to. This is for 2 dimensional. 3 dimensional is a library. And so on.**\n",
